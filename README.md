# Adding VSCode support to AE5

This repository allows AE5 customers to install VSCode into the AE5
editor container and use it within AE5. When successfully completed, 
VSCode will be made available as an editor selection in AE's dropdown
menus alongside Jupyter, JupyterLab, and Zeppelin.

Further instructions to come. Note however that unlike the RStudio
enhancement, this does not have licensing issues that require customer
installation.
